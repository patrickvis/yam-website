      "This piece titled “Current” is roughly 22×30 inches and it is for graduating an art studio I’ve gone to for a large part of my life. It is a mixed media piece with marker, pastel, watercolor, acrylic, ink, and gold leaf. The girl in the middle symbolizes who I am. To break it down, her dress merges into my old art pieces and a wolf’s tail, meaning that my past struggles and effort is always part of what my art is today. You can see her drawing the end of the wolf’s tail— which symbolizes that despite artistic expression being such a scary thing for me, it also protects me and makes me feel comfortable and safe. A lot of the other smaller components are for visuals. This piece took me around 15 hours, and it really emphasizes that artists use a ton of effort to create something they’re proud of and it takes years for them to build themselves up in order to be proud and keep improving. It challenges the misconception that art is easy and effortless and really points out the journey an artist takes.",

My artwork includes utility poles falling and the adult elephants blocks it from hitting the baby. This artwork symbolizes that people grow and come to realize they are responsible for more things they never have to care about as a child. A child depends on others to be protected and is unaware of dangers. Overtime, they will have to take over their parent’s job of protecting a child. Everyone will come to a time when there are people or things that they love and cherish, and that is when they learn about responsibilities and protection.",

Why are we allowed to do and say certain things as a child but not as a teenager or adult - what does innocence excuse?  Is knowledge always power? Or does it blind us to the freedom of exploration? ... I want the viewer to believe they can once again unleash their mind to the vast realm of possibility. We may not be able to regain innocence and discard knowledge, but we can inspire ourselves to dream once more.",

        You are not right.

        You are granted. <br />
        <br />
        You should be granted to every human being the moment they descend onto

        it. <br />
        <br />
        We should take you for granted. This is something every human being
        deserves. <br />
        <br />
        But then, why am I here, searching for you? You aren't present. Like
        what my teacher used to say when I wouldn't respond to the
        mispronunciation of my name. There's nothing to take for granted,
        because, well, I was granted nothing. <br />
        <br />I am here, scrounging around with nothing but the change in my
        pocket and the hope in my heart, looking for you. I am here, seeking to
        find you, all by myself. I am here, on a path of self-discovery, trying
        to locate the vital thing I need to make my life worth living. <br />
        <br />
        This tiring, endless journey has brought me to where you are supposed to
        be. Among the blue uniforms, shiny badges, and armed black waistbands.
        Correcting the wrong, trapping the bad, removing the evil. Inside the
        gray building, with its unforgiving, sharp edges, sterile glass windows,
        and manicured front lawn. After all these miles and all this time, is
        this the place that I've been waiting for? <br />
        <br />I am here, waiting for you. No matter how hard I must fight, or
        how demeaning the pain is to endure, I will remain at this very place,
        anticipating the day you come. <br />
        <br />
        You may be written on paper or talked about by our leaders, but that is
        not enough. You must be embedded into the people and be at the core of
        our beings. <br />
        <br />
        The consciousness is leaving my body, the lethargy is taking over. I am
        stuck, not an ounce of energy left. I reach and reach, but there's
        nothing left.
